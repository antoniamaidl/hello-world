Let's have a look of the outcome of a survey analysing atheism around the world. We want to create a plot with the ratio of atheists in a given country in 2012. For that we first need to re-design the data table to get the survey answer as actual column with number of survey responders per column. We do that with "pivot_wider". Then we mutate the data set, as there a few countries with no atheists (at least according to the survey :) ), overwriting "na" with 0. 

Then we create a new nice data set called clean_atheism2012. Afterwards, we calculate the ratio and plot!

```{r Atheism}
# Import atheism data
atheism_data <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'atheism.csv'))

#changing input to if response is atheist, then "yes" for non-atheist "no"
clean_atheism2012 <- atheism_data %>%
filter(year==2012) %>%
group_by(nationality, response) %>%
summarise(count = n()) %>%
pivot_wider(names_from = response, values_from = count) %>%
mutate_if(is.numeric, funs(ifelse(is.na(.), 0, .))) 
  
colnames(clean_atheism2012) <- c("country","no_atheist", "atheist") 

ratio_atheism <- clean_atheism2012 %>%
summarise(ratio=(atheist)/(no_atheist + atheist)) %>%
arrange(desc(ratio)) 

ratio_plot <- ggplot(ratio_atheism, aes(x=reorder(country, -ratio), y=ratio)) + geom_point()+  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + labs(title="Ratio of Atheists per Country in 2012", y="Atheist ratio out of total survey responders") + theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),plot.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold"), axis.title = element_text(size=6)) 
ratio_plot

```
> Surprisingly, it's only China, Japan, Czech Republic and France that have above 20% of atheists. Most countries that follow afterwards are mainly European countries. It would be interesting to see how results would look like in 2020! 


I'm German, so let's have a look at the development of atheism in Germany from 2005 to 2012. To visualise, we create two boxplots, this makes it pretty easy to see!
```{r Atheism}
atheism_germany <- atheism_data %>%
filter(nationality=="Germany") %>%
  group_by(response, year) %>%
  summarise(count=n())

bp_germany<- ggplot(atheism_germany, aes(x="", y=count, fill=response))+
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + facet_wrap(~ year) + labs(title="Development of atheism in Germany", subtitle="From 2005 to 2012", y="Number of survey responders") +  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),plot.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold"), axis.title = element_text(size=10)) 
bp_germany
```
> Atheism increased by quite a bit between 2005 to 2012 in Germany. Looking at the boxplot, it looks like around 25 out of 500 survey responders became atheists, that's 5%, leading to a total of around 15%!


Now, thinking of a religious country in Europe, Italy comes to my mind. Let's have a look at Italy!

```{r Atheism}
atheism_italy <- atheism_data %>%
filter(nationality=="Italy") %>%
  group_by(response, year) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

bp_italy<- ggplot(atheism_italy, aes(x="", y=count, fill=response))+
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + facet_wrap(~ year)  + labs(title="Development of atheism in Italy", subtitle="From 2005 to 2012", y="Number of survey responders") +  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),plot.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold"), axis.title = element_text(size=10)) 
bp_italy
```
>In comparison to Germany, fewer people were atheists in 2005. Looking at the boxplot, probably around 60 suruvey responders. To 2012, this also only increased partially. Probably to a total number of 75. That's a total of 7.5%, so around half of Germany's rate.
